A standalone box that:

- receives up to N (N>8) cables as capacitive inputs
- outputs MIDI over standard fat MIDI cable
- you can set the MIDI channel 
- maybe: has a "all notes off" button
- in an enclosure that keeps dust out

Building blocks:
1. interface to connect input cables
2. capacitive-to-I2C board (MPR121 Breakout V12 Proximity Capacitive Touch Sensor Module)
3. Microcontroller (arduino?)
4. interface to output MIDI 
5. additional interfaces for midi channel selection and all-note-off button
